#🩺 MammoGen: Synthetic Mammogram Generation for Breast Cancer Detection

##📖 Overview
MammoGAN is a deep learning project that uses StyleGAN and CycleGAN to generate high-quality synthetic mammograms. This helps in overcoming data scarcity and privacy concerns while improving breast cancer detection models.

##🎯 Project Objectives
✅ Generate realistic synthetic mammograms using StyleGAN.
✅ Enhance data diversity and improve deep learning models.
✅ Use CycleGAN for domain adaptation (improving image realism).
✅ Ensure privacy compliance by reducing dependency on real patient data.

##📂 Dataset
Dataset Used: CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM)
Data Format: DICOM images
Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation

##🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
Generative Models: StyleGAN, CycleGAN
Libraries Used: OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy, pydicom

##📊 Results
✅ Improved breast cancer detection accuracy (10–20%)
✅ Increased dataset diversity & model generalization
✅ Reduced dependence on real patient data (50–70%)

##🔬 Future Scope
🔹 Improve image quality using StyleGAN3
🔹 Experiment with conditional GANs (cGANs)
🔹 Collaborate with hospitals & AI researchers
